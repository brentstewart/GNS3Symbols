GNS3 includes function-based symbols that are easy to read, but the
same symbol is used for multiple virtual devices and this becomes confusing
in a complicated topology.  I've collected icons for different types
of VMs that identify the device by brand and function.  Images have been
resized in accordance with GNS3 usage.
